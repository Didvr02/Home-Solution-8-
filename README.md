# Homework 8

1. **Streamingâ€‘Service Binge Mode** (Iterator Pattern)
2. **Airport Tower Simulator** (Mediator Pattern)



## ðŸ“¦ Part 1 â€“ Iterator Pattern: "Streamingâ€‘Service Binge Mode"

### âœ… Project Goal

Simulate a simplified Netflix-like streaming platform where:

- A series contains multiple seasons.
- Each season stores episodes differently (e.g., `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, or custom storage).
- The UI should iterate over all episodes without knowing how they're stored.

### ðŸ”§ Features

- Custom `EpisodeIterator` interface with:
  - `boolean hasNext()`
  - `Episode next()`
- Three concrete iterators:
  - `SeasonIterator` â€“ normal order
  - `ReverseSeasonIterator` â€“ reverse order
  - `ShuffleSeasonIterator` â€“ random order with fixed seed
- `Season` implements `Iterable<Episode>`, enabling:
  ```java
  for (Episode e : season) {
      System.out.println(e.getTitle());
  }

ðŸ›« Part 2 â€“ Mediator Pattern: "Airport Tower Simulator"
âœ… Project Goal
Simulate a real-world airport environment where multiple aircraft (passenger planes, cargo planes, helicopters) coordinate takeoffs and landings via a centralized Control Tower, rather than communicating directly.

ðŸ”§ Features
TowerMediator interface for communication control

Abstract class Aircraft with:

send() â€” broadcasts messages through the tower

receive() â€” processes incoming messages

Aircraft types:

PassengerPlane

CargoPlane

Helicopter

ControlTower (concrete mediator):

Maintains landing and takeoff queues

Prioritizes emergency aircraft (e.g., MAYDAY, low fuel)

Sends broadcast messages like "hold", "cleared for landing", etc.

Simulation.java:

Spawns 10 random aircraft with varying fuel levels

Sends requests every second using ScheduledExecutorService

Demonstrates normal traffic and emergency behavior in real time

ðŸ§  Why Use Mediator Instead of Direct Communication
Advantages:

Decouples aircraft from each other

Centralizes coordination logic in a single place (ControlTower)

Easily handles complex rules (e.g., emergency handling)
